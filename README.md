# ASFAND Blog Grid

This is a simple web app that showcases a grid-based blog layout with four blog boxes, each displaying a title and excerpt. When you hover over each blog box, it reveals more information and a "READ MORE" link.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The header contains a navigation menu with "HOME," "CONTACT," and "ABOUT" links.
3. The main section displays four blog boxes (box1, box2, box3, and box4).
4. Hover over each blog box to see more details and the "READ MORE" link.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the blog layout and boxes.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the header, blog boxes, and subboxes.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the blog boxes and subboxes by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file.
